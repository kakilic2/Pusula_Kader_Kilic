#Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing for a dataset from the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation domain.  
The dataset contains 2235 observations and 13 features** related to patients, their demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and treatment duration.  
The target variable of interest is TedaviSuresi(seans) (treatment duration in sessions).  
The main goal is to make the dataset clean, consistent, and model-ready for potential predictive modeling.
